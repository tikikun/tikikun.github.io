Inspired by this paper:
- [Chameleon: Mixed-Modal Early-Fusion Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09818)

I have implemented the "image tokenizers" with similiar features in this repo
- [Open Chameleon](https://huggingface.co/alandao/open-chameleon)

I will spend some time later to write down some explaination on how this was done. The tokenizer can tokenize the image with ease and also enable anyone to build an image datatset that 100% compatible to traditional text datasets.

More coming soon...
