## About me

Passionate AI Practitioner that wants to build things!

Some of the things I have built, contributed and invented with my dear friends and colleagues.

Things I have built!

## Ichigo
Ichigo is a multimodal AI model that can handle speech natively with enhanced latency compared to traditional ASR to LLM solution. Find out more below

* https://github.com/janhq/ichigo
* https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15316

## AlphaMaze
AlphaMaze is a novel two-stage training framework that equips LLMs with visual reasoning abilities for maze navigation using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

* https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14669

## Poseless
PoseLess is a novel framework for robot hand control that maps 2D images to joint angles without explicit pose estimation, enabling zero-shot generalization and cross-morphology transfer.

* ## Jan
Jan is the most popular open source AI Chatbot Client with more than 1.5M downloads (and counting up)
* https://github.com/janhq/jan

## Nitro (Now is cortex)
Super light-weight inference engine for LLM models
* https://github.com/janhq/cortex (previously nitro - I invented this)
* https://github.com/janhq/nitro-tensorrt-llm

## Publication
I also wrote a paper! (More coming soon) Check out my Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eGWws2UAAAAJ&hl=en)

I believe in the next 10 years, everyone has the access to the most sophisticated and well-tailored education system that has ever existed by the help of mass AI adoption.

Future is bright!
